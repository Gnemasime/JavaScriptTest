JavaScript  assessment from invisible technologies

# JavaScript Test 1:
You are given two rotated sorted arrays, nums1 and nums2, and a target integer "k". Use Javascript to find all pairs of two numbers (one from each array) whose sum equals the target and return the list. Assume each input array does not contain duplicate elements and both are of the same length.



let nums1 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1];

let nums2 = [3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 19];

let k = 13;

# JavaScript Test 2:
You are given a string of encrypted text. The encryption algorithm used to create this ciphertext shifts all alphabetic characters in the original string by the same amount (essentially, a Caesar cipher). However, the shift amount is unknown.



Write a decipher function that takes two arguments: 1) the encrypted text; 2) a word known to have appeared in the original plaintext. Using these clues, the function must output the original text.



Constraints: Use the English alphabet and maintain the casing of words.
